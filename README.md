# Homework5

I have a workday calendar that lets me quickly add new events, by clicking the plus button, and stores them locally in my browser. As the day progresses, lines marked in red  are where I'm currently at in my calendar, and upcoming events will be in green. Past events are grey. By clearing your browser's cookies you can restart your calendar fresh!

The web application is live here:

Below is a snapshot of how the web app looks:
